        <p style="color: white;" style="font-family: cursive;">11 Comae Berenices b is an extrasolar planet, also known as an exoplanet. It orbits the star 11 Comae Berenices, which is located about 300 light-years away from our Sun in the constellation Coma Berenices.
            <br>
Here are some key facts about 11 Comae Berenices b:
<br>
Discovery: It was discovered in 2007 using the radial velocity method, which detects planets by measuring tiny wobbles in the star's motion caused by the planet's gravitational pull.
<br>
Mass: It's a gas giant with a mass at least 15 times that of Jupiter, making it one of the most massive exoplanets discovered.   
<br>
Orbit: It orbits its star at an average distance of 1.178 AU (astronomical units), which is slightly farther than the distance between Earth and the Sun. Its orbital period is about 323 days.   
<br>
Star: 11 Comae Berenices is a K-type giant star, which is larger and more luminous than our Sun.
<br>

Additional points of interest:
<br>

Hot Jupiter: Due to its proximity to its star, 11 Comae Berenices b is likely a "hot Jupiter," a gas giant with a high surface temperature.
<br>

Atmosphere: While its atmosphere hasn't been directly observed, it's likely composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, similar to Jupiter.
<br>

Formation: The formation of such a massive planet so close to its star is a topic of ongoing research. It challenges some traditional planet formation models.
<br>

11 Comae Berenices b is an interesting object of study for astronomers, providing valuable insights into the diversity of exoplanets and the processes that form them.
