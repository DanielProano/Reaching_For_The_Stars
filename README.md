# Reaching_For_The_Stars

A dynamic web application that uses NASA's Astronomical Archiveto gather information about exoplanets and present them in the form of interactive simulations. 
This is meant to be used as a learning tool.

Technologies used:
1. NetBeans IDE
2. Java
3. JavaScript
4. HTML + CSS
5. THREE.js
6. MySQL
7. DeepAI Image Generating API

# Purpose

This code was made during and for Purdue's BoilerMake Hacking Competition. We took it upon outselves to make something unique. In this project, 
we made a webpage that allows a user to search NASA's Astronomical Archive. This allows users to find the data of over a thousand Exoplanets!

# Simulation

We also built a working simulation of what an Exoplanet might look-like with THREE.js to create a planetary model system.

# Attempted but buggy

We attempted to create an interface that connected to NASAs database in real time, allowing us to access all the information NASA has to offer. While the parsing and web request work, unforunately we  a could not get this code working with NetBeans. Therefore, we had to resort to hard coding the data. With more time however, we could have had working interface that connects to NASAs database.
